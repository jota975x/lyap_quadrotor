# lyap_quadrotor
This repository contains the implementation of a control strategy for stabilizing and controlling the trajectory of a planar quadrotor using Lyapunov Control Functions. The goal is to achieve precise control over the quadrotor's position and orientation while ensuring system stability.

## Introduction
A planar quadrotor is a simplified model of a quadrotor that operates in a 2D plane with three degrees of freedom: horizontal position, vertical position, and rotation about the center of mass. This project uses Lyapunov-based control to ensure the stability of the quadrotor and regulate its trajectory to follow a desired path. Lyapunov's stability theory provides a systematic way to design control laws that guarantee system stability and desired performance.

## Features 
* Planar Quadrotor Dynamics: Models the dynamics of a quadrotor in a 2D plane with three degrees of freedom.
* Lyapunov Control Design: Implements control laws based on Lyapunov's second method to stabilize the system.
* Trajectory Tracking: Controls the quadrotor to follow a desired trajectory (e.g., circular, straight line).
* Visualization: Plots the quadrotor's position and orientation as it follows the desired trajectory.

## Control Strategy
This project uses a Lyapunov control approach to stabilize the quadrotor's motion. The basic steps include:

1. System Modeling: The planar quadrotor is modeled with state variables representing position, velocity, and orientation.
2. Lyapunov Function: A candidate Lyapunov function is designed to reflect the system's energy and ensure stability.
3. Control Law: Control inputs (thrust and torque) are derived to minimize the Lyapunov function, ensuring asymptotic stability and trajectory tracking.

## Lyapunov Function
The Lyapunov function, ùëâ(ùë•), is chosen to ensure that the quadrotor's energy decreases over time, stabilizing the system. The control law is designed such that the time derivative of ùëâ(ùë•) is negative definite.

## Results
The simulation results demonstrate that the Lyapunov-based control strategy effectively stabilizes the quadrotor and allows it to follow the desired trajectory. Key results include:
1. Stable Trajectory Tracking: The quadrotor successfully follows the reference trajectory with minimal deviation.
2. Control Inputs: The thrust and torque inputs remain within feasible limits.
3. Lyapunov Stability: The Lyapunov function decreases monotonically over time, confirming system stability.
